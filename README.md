# MATLAB Library

This MATLAB library provides a collection of functions for various signal processing and data analysis tasks. The library includes functions for calculating ratios, performing signal detection, applying wavelet transforms, and more.

## Installation

To use this MATLAB library, simply download the repository and add the library directory to your MATLAB path. The library is compatible with MATLAB versions XX and above.

## Usage

The library consists of the following functions:

1. `ERM`: Implements the ERM (Exponential Rejection Method) algorithm for signal processing.
2. `ratios`: Calculates ratios of given input signals.
3. `compute_threshold`: Computes a threshold value based on input data.
4. `detection`: Performs signal detection using a specified threshold.
5. `eff`: Calculates the efficiency of a given signal.
6. `cut_burnin`: Cuts the burn-in period from a time series.
7. `daub`: Applies the Daubechies wavelet transform to a signal.
8. `aprox`: Computes the approximation coefficients using wavelet transform.
9. `appcoef`: Calculates the approximation coefficients of a signal.

Please refer to the individual function documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples.
